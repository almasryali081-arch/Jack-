## 🧠 About Me

I'm Ali — a developer who refuses to be just a user.  
To me, the terminal isn't just a black screen — it's a creative canvas where I write my tools, my thoughts, and my digital identity.

- 💻 **Full control:** through Linux and Termux  
- 🎨 **Creative scripting:** with Bash, Python, and HTML5  
- 🌐 **Visual design:** CSS effects, ASCII art, and expressive domain names  
- 🛡️ **Cyber curiosity:** exploring ethical hacking and digital autonomy

> “I don’t just write code — I write myself, line by line, in a world I choose to build.”
